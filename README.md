# GFDL_atmos_cubed_sphere

The source contained herein reflects the 202305 release of the Finite Volume Cubed-Sphere Dynamical Core (FV3) from GFDL

The GFDL Microphysics is also available within this repository.

# Where to find information

Visit the [FV3 website](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fv3/) for more information. Reference material is available at [FV3 documentation and references](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fv3/fv3-documentation-and-references/).

# Proper usage attribution

Cite _Putman and Lin (2007)_ and _Harris and Lin (2013)_ when describing a model using the FV3 dynamical core.

Cite _Chen et al (2013)_ and _Zhou et al (2019)_ when using the GFDL Microphysics.

# Documentation

The up-to-date FV3 Scientific reference guide is included in LaTex and PDF formats in the ```docs/``` directory. There are also some notebooks in docs/examples demonstrating basic FV3 capabilities and analysis techniques.

A [DOI referenceable version](https://doi.org/10.25923/6nhs-5897) is available in the [_NOAA Institutional Repository_](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/30725)
