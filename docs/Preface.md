##Disclaimer
We have made every effort to ensure that the information in this document is as accurate, complete, and as up-to-date as possible. However, due to the rapid pace of FV&sup3; and FV&sup3;-powered model development the document may not always reflect the current state of FV&sup3; capabilities. Often, the code itself is the best description of the current capabilities and the available options, which due to limited space cannot all be described in full detail here. 
Contact GFDL FV&sup3; support:  oar.gfdl.fv3_dycore_support@noaa.gov  for questions regarding the FV3 Dynamical Core 
and  oar.gfdl.shield_support@noaa.gov for questions regarding the GFDL SHiELD weather prediction model.
