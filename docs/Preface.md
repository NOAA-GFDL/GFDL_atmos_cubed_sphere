The documentation is a collection of information from many different works including:

- FV<sup>3</sup> The GFDL Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere Dynamical Core dated 28 November 2017 found at: https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FV3-Technical-Description.pdf
- The Nonhydrostatic Solver of the GFDL Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere Dynamical Core dated 10 November 2020 found at: https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/27489 


##Disclaimer
We have made every effort to ensure that the information in this document is as accurate, complete, and as up-to-date as possible. However, due to the rapid pace of FV&sup3; and FV&sup3;-powered model development the document may not always reflect the current state of FV&sup3; capabilities. Often, the code itself is the best description of the current capabilities and the available options, which due to limited space cannot all be described in full detail here. 
Contact GFDL FV<sup>3</sup> support:  oar.gfdl.fv3_dycore_support@noaa.gov  for questions regarding the FV<sup>3</sup> Dynamical Core.
