    "\n",
    "These are 2D (x-z) tests which use a five-point wide domain in the y-direction; the flow is very nearly homogeneous in the y-direction. **Note** that FV3 is a *fully-compressible* model and should not be expected to reproduce Boussinesq solutions. In particular gravity waves will increase in amplitude with height in FV3, which is especially pronounced in these mountain wave tests that often prescribe domains with tops at 30 km or higher. In particular tests that rely on precise amplitudes of mountain waves against a Bousinessq exact solution are inappropriate for any fully-compressible solver.\n",

    "Since FV3 uses hybrid-pressure coordinates it is a little tricky to set up the initial state given in terms of height coordinates and buoyancy frequencies. See the notebook MountainWaveIC to see how this is done. \n",

We use a pre-defined 40-level setup from FV3 with a top at 50 mb (about 18 km), with Rayleigh damping applied above 250 mb that uses the usual arctangent profile in FV3.

    "## Resting flow test\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses a variant of the test of S-H Park et al (MWR, 2019). Here, the atmosphere above a small-scale mountain ridge is at rest until 10 km AGL, where a jet linearly ramps up to 20 m/s at 14 km AGL and is uniform above; and in which the atmosphere uses a uniform buoyancy frequency of 0.01 below 10 km and a more stable layer of 0.02 above. This atmosphere filters out errors in the lower troposphere (which would appear in the above Schar test or in the uniform atmosphere of the mtn_rest_100km test) to isolate errors due to the transition between hybrid and pure-pressure coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use a higher level for the jet in line with the hybridization used in most global models, which require placing the level at which the pure-pressure coordinate begins at about 100--300 mb, higher than in many mesoscale models. We also use the same 50 vertical level setup already existent within FV3.\n",
    "\n",
    "This test emphasizes errors due to PGF errors in the upper troposphere (within the shear layer); the lower buoyancy frequency at lower layers reduces the vertical propagation of errors due to the PGF there. We find (again) that these are small, but can be enhanced due to a mis-configuration of the solver. \n"

One might think that adding more diffusion would damp the already very-low errors. The simulation below uses sixth-order divergence damping and stronger vorticity damping (0.06). The errors become substantially worse, especially near the surface in which there should not be any error at all. This is an example in which *less* damping gives a *better* result!\n",

This also speaks to the strength of FV3 in that it can be configured to give great results at **any resolution**.
