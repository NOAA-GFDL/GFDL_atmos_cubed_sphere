Foreword {#foreword}
========================
(This information is a reproduction of the Foreword from HCZC20)

The nonhydrostatic solver in FV3 was wholly designed by Dr. Shian-Jiann Lin, now retired from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. What follows is our interpretation of the nonhydrostatic solver and sufficient background of the general FV3 algorithm to understand the nonhydrostatic implementation. This technical note acts as a means to document the nonhydrostatic FV3 and to ensure that credit is properly given to Dr. Lin.
